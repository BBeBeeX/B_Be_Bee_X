/**
 * A stand-in for `expo-sqlite` under Vitest.
 *
 * `core-db-expo` imports the driver at module scope, which is right for Metro
 * and impossible in Node. Aliasing it here is what lets the *second* `ctx.db`
 * implementation run the same suites as the first — and that matters more here
 * than anywhere else, because the gate is the thing MD-4 says used to be
 * present on desktop and absent on mobile. A capability that means one thing
 * on one platform and nothing on the other is worse than no capability.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Not a fake database.** It is `node:sqlite` behind the `expo-sqlite`
 * surface, so the SQL really runs, the migrations really apply, and a check
 * that passes here passed against SQLite rather than against a mock's opinion
 * of it. What it does not reproduce is the *SDK's* SQLite build — the version,
 * and therefore `contentless_delete=1` — which stays a device concern
 * (docs/11 §8).
