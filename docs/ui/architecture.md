# UI Architecture & Descriptor Contribution Model

> **Legacy Reference:** Formerly `docs/08-ui-architecture.md §1 – §5, §7 – §9`.

> **What this answers.** **Layer 5** of [02 §1](../architecture/layers.md#1-the-layer-model): how a
> single plugin contributes user interface to two shells that share no component code, how views
> find their data without owning it, and where the boundary between "logic" and "view" is drawn.

Per [ADR-2](../architecture/overview.md#adr-2--the-ui-is-split-react-native-on-mobile-react-dom-on-desktop),
there are two view layers: React Native on mobile and React DOM on desktop. The cost of that
choice is paid entirely here, and this document is about containing it.

---

## 1. The three-package convention

A feature with UI splits into up to three packages. The split is not bureaucracy — it is what
keeps ADR-2 from doubling the *whole* feature instead of just its pixels.

```
@BBeBee/plugin-scrobble               ← headless: service, state, events, persistence
@BBeBee/plugin-scrobble-ui-mobile     ← React Native views
@BBeBee/plugin-scrobble-ui-desktop    ← React DOM views
```

| Package | Layer | Contains | May import |
|---|---|---|---|
| headless | 4 | The Cordis plugin, all logic, all state, all DB access, all networking | `@BBeBee/protocol` only |
| `-ui-mobile` | 5 | Components and the descriptors that name them | `react`, `react-native`, `@BBeBee/ui-kit-mobile`, and the headless package's **public subpaths** — its types plus the shared hooks and view ids (`/hooks`, `/views`) |
| `-ui-desktop` | 5 | Components and the descriptors that name them | `react`, `react-dom`, `@BBeBee/ui-kit-desktop`, and the headless package's **public subpaths** — its types plus the shared hooks and view ids (`/hooks`, `/views`) |

The split is the Layer 4/Layer 5 boundary made concrete. Layer 5 is where business *orchestration*
lives — this button, then that confirmation, then this navigation — while the business *rule* it
orchestrates stays at Layer 4, where it can be tested without a renderer and reused by the other
target's views unchanged.

The rule that makes it work:

> **A UI package contains no logic that would need to be written twice.**

If you are about to write the same `if` in both UI packages, it belongs in the headless one —
usually as a derived value on the service or a selector it exposes. In practice the UI packages
end up thin: layout, gestures, and event wiring.

The headless package works alone. A plugin with no UI package still functions; it simply
contributes nothing visible, which is exactly what happens on a target where its view was not
written.

### 1.1 Package internal organization & component decomposition

To prevent UI packages from turning into monolithic files containing thousands of lines, each UI package is decomposed into single-responsibility submodules:

```
packages/ui/<package>/src/
├── components/          ← Reusable presentation elements, artwork tiles, cards, track rows
│   ├── sections/        ← Partitioned feature sections (e.g. settings panels)
│   └── modals/          ← Dedicated dialogs and modal edit flows
├── screens/             ← Top-level screens / view targets (e.g. SearchScreen, PlaylistDetailScreen)
├── hooks/               ← Local UI state & interaction hooks (e.g. useTrackLibraryInfo)
├── utils/               ← Pure UI data transformers and helpers
└── index.tsx            ← Plugin registration facade (apply(ctx)) and backward-compatible re-exports
```

Reaching beyond basic organization, UI packages and UI infrastructure follow consistent modularization rules:
- **UI Kit Component Structure**: Core UI kit packages (`ui-kit-mobile`, `ui-kit-desktop`) isolate theme tokens and styling primitives into `primitives.ts`, component definitions into atomic files under `src/components/*.tsx` (`Button`, `Text`, `TextField`, `Slider`, `Sheet`, `ContextMenu`, `List`, `Artwork`, `TrackRow`, `Toast`, `JsonTree`, plus desktop-only `StickyDetailBar` and `coverTheme`), and barrel re-export through `src/index.tsx`.
- **Menu Controller Architecture**: Context menu hooks in `ui-menus` separate submenus (`src/submenus/*.ts`), individual entity menus (`src/menus/*.ts`), and anchor positioning utilities (`src/types.ts`).
- **Screen View Decomposition**: Heavy screens with multiple view modes (such as `LibraryScreen`) decouple view renderings into `src/components/views/*` (`CollapsedLibraryView`, `ExpandedLibraryView`, `SidebarFolderView`), action and data hydration into `src/hooks/*` (`useLibraryHydration`, `useLibraryActions`), and control bars/modals into `src/components/*`.
- **Pure Helper Hoisting**: Reusable pure logic that outgrows one feature (such as formatting durations, artwork IDs, and string helpers) belongs in `@BBeBee/toolkit` (Layer 4 pure library), maintaining a single source of truth across desktop and mobile without duplication.

---

## 2. Contributions are descriptors

Plugins never hand components to the shell directly. They register **descriptors** — serialisable
declarations naming a view — and the shell resolves the name against its own registry.

```ts
export type Contribution =
  | RouteContribution
  | SlotContribution
  | CommandContribution
  | SettingsContribution
  | MenuContribution

export interface RouteContribution {
  kind: 'route'
  id: string                       // 'scrobble.history'
  path: string                     // '/scrobble/history'
  title: string                    // i18n key
  icon?: string                    // name from the shared icon set (Tabler icons, stroke 1.25 on desktop)
  /** Where the shell should offer navigation to it. */
  placement?: ('sidebar' | 'tab-bar' | 'more-menu')[]
  order?: number
}

export interface SlotContribution {
  kind: 'slot'
  id: string
  slot: SlotId                     // a well-known extension point
  order?: number
  /** Evaluated against slot context to decide visibility. Pure, cheap, synchronous. */
  when?: (ctx: SlotContext) => boolean
}

export interface CommandContribution {
  kind: 'command'
  id: string                       // 'player.togglePlay'
  title: string
  icon?: string
  defaultKeybinding?: string       // desktop only; ignored on mobile
  run(args?: unknown): void | Promise<void>
}

export interface SettingsContribution {
  kind: 'settings'
  id: string
  section: 'general' | 'playback' | 'audio' | 'sources' | 'storage' | 'advanced'
  title: string
  /** Rendered automatically from the schema unless a custom view is registered. */
  schema?: StandardSchemaV1
}

export interface MenuContribution {
  kind: 'menu'
  id: string
  /** Desktop application menu bar. Mobile maps these into the more-menu. */
  menu: 'file' | 'edit' | 'view' | 'playback' | 'help'
  title: string
  /** The command run when selected — menus never carry their own logic. */
  command: string
  order?: number
  /** Rendered as a checkbox item, driven by this predicate. */
  checked?: () => boolean
}

export interface UiService {
  contribute(c: Contribution): Disposable
  /** Called by each shell's view package to bind an id to a component. */
  registerView(id: string, component: unknown): Disposable

  readonly routes: readonly RouteContribution[]
  slotsFor(slot: SlotId): readonly SlotContribution[]
  readonly commands: readonly CommandContribution[]
  runCommand(id: string, args?: unknown): Promise<void>
  viewFor(id: string): unknown | undefined
}
```

`registerView` takes `unknown` deliberately: `@BBeBee/protocol` must not depend on `react`,
`react-native`, or `react-dom`, since it is imported by headless plugins that run in contexts with
no React at all. The shells cast at the boundary — one `as ComponentType` in one place per shell,
rather than a React dependency reaching into the contract layer.

> ⚠️ **Register a component bound to *your* context, never the shell's.** A shell renders a view
> as `h(Component, { ctx })` with the context it was mounted on — `app.ready(['ui'])`, which has
> `ui` injected and nothing else — and a cordis context throws for any property outside its inject
> list. A screen that reads `ctx.player` or `ctx.inspector` off the forwarded prop therefore throws
> *during render*, on a device, while every test that built a plain root context passed. Every view
> package here closes over the context its own plugin was applied with (a local `bound(ctx, Screen)`
> helper) and forwards the shell's other props; the one that did not shipped a page that rendered
> as a black window.
>
> The shells catch it either way — a view that throws is caught per route and rendered as a named
> failure, not as an unmounted app — but the boundary is a net, not the contract.

### Slots

Well-known extension points, enumerated in `@BBeBee/protocol` so both shells implement the same set:

```ts
export type SlotId =
  | 'now-playing.actions'        // buttons beside the transport
  | 'now-playing.panel'          // tabs in the expanded player (lyrics, queue, related)
  | 'track.context-menu'         // right-click / long-press on a track
  | 'album.context-menu'
  | 'library.sidebar'            // extra library sections
  | 'search.results-section'     // an extra results group
  | 'settings.sources'            // the source list: import, groups, enable, reorder
  | 'source.browse'               // a source's explore tree
  | 'source.test'                // one source, exercised feature by feature (06 §10)
  | 'status-bar'                 // desktop only; ignored on mobile
```

Slot rendering is where a plugin's UI actually shows up:

```tsx
// @BBeBee/ui-kit-desktop
export function Slot({ id, context }: { id: SlotId; context: SlotContext }) {
  const items = useSlot(id, context)
  return <>{items.map((it) => {
    const View = ui.viewFor(it.id) as ComponentType<{ context: SlotContext }> | undefined
    return View ? <View key={it.id} context={context} /> : null
  })}</>
}
```

---

## 3. Resolving a descriptor to a view

The descriptor names a view id. The shell looks it up in a registry populated by whichever UI
package was loaded for *this* target.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    H["headless plugin<br/>ctx.ui.contribute({ kind:'slot', id:'scrobble.badge', slot:'now-playing.actions' })"]
    UM["-ui-mobile<br/>ctx.ui.registerView('scrobble.badge', RNBadge)"]
    UD["-ui-desktop<br/>ctx.ui.registerView('scrobble.badge', DomBadge)"]
    R["ctx.ui registry"]
    SM["mobile shell renders RNBadge"]
    SD["desktop shell renders DomBadge"]
    H --> R
    UM --> R
    UD --> R
    R --> SM
    R --> SD
```

**Missing views are normal, not an error.** A plugin may ship a desktop view and no mobile one
(a multi-column log inspector), or the reverse (a gesture-driven mini player). The contribution
still registers; the slot simply renders nothing for it. This is a direct, ongoing cost of ADR-2,
and making it a first-class state rather than a crash is what keeps it survivable.

Three consequences worth enforcing:

- A descriptor must carry enough information to be *listed* without its view — a title and icon.
  A settings page with no view for this target can still appear, disabled, with "not available on
  this platform", rather than leaving a hole the user cannot explain.
- `when` predicates run in the shell and must be synchronous and cheap; they run during render.
- A command with no view is fully functional — it appears in the command palette on desktop and
  in the more-menu on mobile. Commands are the cheapest way to make a feature reachable on both
  targets.

---

## 4. Binding services to React

The rule from [02 §6](../architecture/layers.md#6-state-ownership): **React holds no domain state.**
Services own it; components subscribe.

Both `ui-kit-mobile` and `ui-kit-desktop` build on one shared, framework-agnostic hook layer in
`@BBeBee/ui-core`, which depends only on `react` and `@BBeBee/protocol`:

```ts
// @BBeBee/ui-core
export function useService<K extends ServiceKey>(key: K): Context[K] | undefined

/**
 * Subscribe to service state via useSyncExternalStore, so React 18 concurrent
 * rendering cannot tear. `select` must be referentially stable across calls
 * for unchanged inputs — return primitives or memoised objects.
 */
export function useServiceState<K extends ServiceKey, T>(
  key: K,
  events: (keyof Events)[],
  select: (svc: Context[K]) => T,
): T
```

Feature-specific hooks are thin wrappers, and they live in the **headless** package so both shells
share them:

```ts
// @BBeBee/plugin-player/hooks — shared by both UI packages
export const useTransport = () =>
  useServiceState('player', ['player/state-changed'], (p) => p.state)

export const useQueue = () =>
  useServiceState('player', ['queue/changed'], (p) => p.queue)

/** Position updates at 1 Hz; the UI interpolates with rAF between ticks. */
export const usePosition = () =>
  useServiceState('player', ['player/position'], (p) => p.state.positionMs)
```

This is where the three-package split earns its keep. The hooks — the part with actual logic about
which events invalidate which state — are written once. Only the JSX is written twice.

### Rendering rules

- **No `useEffect` for domain work.** An effect that fetches, writes, or mutates domain state
  belongs in a service method the component calls.
- **Optimistic updates live in the service**, not the component, so both shells behave identically
  when a write fails and rolls back.
- **Lists virtualise.** `FlashList` on mobile, `@tanstack/react-virtual` on desktop. A library can
  hold 100k tracks; neither platform survives rendering that.
- **A detail page's header scrolls away with its list.** The desktop `List` owns a `header` slot
  (hero, action bar — whatever scrolls off), a `sticky` slot (the `StickyDetailBar` that slides in
  from above the viewport as the header's play button approaches, leaving title + play button +
  the table header — the Spotify layout), a `stickyHeader` slot (the table header, pinned just
  below the bar), and `onScroll`. The choreography is measured,
  not assumed (`useDetailBarCollapse` reads the play button's distance to the scrollport top per
  scroll event): the bar docks — its compact play button scales in — when its edge has covered
  half the button. The virtualiser is offset by everything above the rows, *measured* off the
  spacer's real position (`scrollMargin`, watched by `ResizeObserver` and a scroll listener —
  a wrapped title makes it unknowable from props). The sticky bar and the pinned table header
  must both be the scroller's **direct children**: `position: sticky` only sticks within its
  parent's box, so nesting them in the header would scroll them away exactly when they finish
  arriving.
- **`player/position` is interpolated, never polled.** The event fires at 1 Hz
  ([07 §5](../data-model/events.md#5-the-event-map)); a progress bar animates between ticks with
  `requestAnimationFrame` and re-syncs on each event.
- **Artwork renders `blurhash` first**, then the image
  ([07 §4.2](../data-model/schema.md#42-artwork)). No layout shift, no grey flash on scroll. A remote
  cover is requested with **no `Referer`**: several CDNs answer a hotlink 403 when the referrer is
  a foreign origin (Bilibili's `hdslb.com` does, and in dev the renderer's referrer is
  `localhost`), which shows every result as a broken image while the same URL opens fine in a tab.
- **A cover is resolved through `ctx.cache` before it renders.** The view packages render the kits'
  `Artwork` through a local `CachedArtwork` that calls `useResolvedArtwork(ctx, ref)`
  (`@BBeBee/plugin-cache/hooks`) — and `TrackRow`, which draws its own `Artwork` internally,
  through a `CachedTrackRow` — so the URL handed to `<img>`/`Image` is a local file whenever the
  cache has one, and the `dominantColor`/identicon fallback covers the fetch in flight: the remote
  URL is never what gets rendered. The cached copy also fills in `artworks.local_uri`, which is
  what lets the lock screen receive a local `Uri` ([04 §7](../services/contracts.md)).
- **Artwork with no image falls back to a generated identicon.** When there is no cover to load —
  a local file without embedded art gets no `artworks` row at all — `Artwork` renders a
  GitHub-identicon-style square derived from the entity's URN: a FNV-1a hash of the seed drives a
  vertically mirrored 5×5 cell grid and a hue, painted as a dark tint behind a vivid pattern. The
  pattern is computed once in `ui-core` (`identicon()`), so both kits hash the same URN to the
  same square; only the elements differ (SVG on desktop, `View`s on mobile — no `react-native-svg`
  native module). Derived data never outranks real data: an image beats an identicon, and a
  `dominant_color` extracted from a real cover beats both. No identity (`seed` absent, no
  `artwork.id`) means no pattern — the plain colour square stands.
- **A detail page takes its theme colour from its cover.** The screens with a single cover
  (Album, Playlist — first track's artwork when the playlist has none) compose
  `useResolvedArtwork` + the kit's `useImageColor`: the ref's `dominantColor` — computed once at
  cache time — wins; a ref without one gets a one-shot canvas extraction (`extractVibrantColor`,
  vividness-scored buckets, run on the same URL the `<img>` shows); an unreadable cover (remote
  URL without CORS taints the canvas) returns `undefined`. `coverGradient(tint)` builds the
  section background and the sticky bar's wash, and `undefined` falls back to the neutral brand
  gradient — a missing cover degrades to what the page looked like before, never to an error.

### Context menus & Library Interaction

Right-click on desktop, long-press on mobile, one menu. `TrackRow.onMore`, `UnifiedLibraryRow.onMore`, and header action controls hand the pointer anchor to the screen; the screen holds a controller from `@BBeBee/ui-menus` and renders the kit's `ContextMenu`. The **model** — which actions exist for a track, a playlist, a collection, and what each one calls — is written once in `@BBeBee/ui-menus`; the kits know how to draw menu rows and nothing about playlists or queues, which is what keeps the shells' menus unified down to the order of the items.

#### Visual and Component Model
- **Container styling**: High-contrast dark streaming card (`#242424`), 8px border radius, 4px padding, `0 12px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.55)` depth shadow, and subtle 1px border (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)`).
- **Dividers**: Menu items support `divider: true` to draw a 1px translucent separator line above critical or dangerous operations.
- **Icons**: Standard operations (`pencil`, `trash`, `pin`, `plus`, `folder`, `play-filled`, `download`, `playlist`) resolve to Tabler SVG icons (`stroke: 1.25`) with consistent 16px geometry.
- **Submenus & Viewport Clamping**: Submenu triggers render a chevron indicator (`chevron-right`). Submenus dynamically exclude cyclic candidates (e.g. "Add to other playlists" excludes the source playlist, "Move to folder" excludes the current folder and descendant folders). Submenu positioning computes real-time horizontal and vertical viewport flipping, dynamically clamping `maxHeight` and enabling internal scrolling so flyout menus never overflow the screen.

#### Entity Context Menu Specifications
- **Track Context Menu**:
  - `add-to-playlist`: "Add to playlist" submenu. Tracks belong exclusively to playlists or albums and cannot be added directly to folders.
  - `remove-from-playlist`: Danger tone with divider, shown only when the row is rendered within a playlist.
  - `add-favourite` / `remove-favourite`: Heart/unheart track in library and source.
  - `enqueue`: Append track to end of playback queue.
  - `download`: Queue track for offline download.
  - `sleep-timer`: Configure playback sleep timer countdown.
  - `go-to-album`: Navigate to album detail view when `track.albumUrn` is present.
- **Playlist Context Menu**:
  - `edit-details`: Opens `EditPlaylistModal` to modify cover art (via local file chooser or remote URL), title, and description via `ctx.library.updatePlaylist`.
  - `delete-playlist`: Danger tone with top divider, triggers `ConfirmDeleteModal` for explicit secondary confirmation before invoking `ctx.library.deletePlaylist`.
  - `toggle-pin`: Pin/unpin from top of library list.
  - `add-to-playlist`: "Add to other playlists", excluding current playlist.
  - `add-to-collection`: "Move to folder", supports existing folders, creating new folders, or moving to root with automatic source folder cleanup.
- **Album Context Menu**:
  - `delete-album`: Danger tone with top divider, triggers `ConfirmDeleteModal` for explicit secondary confirmation before removing the album from the library (`ctx.library.setSaved(urn, false)`) and any enclosing folder (`ctx.library.removeFromCollection`).
  - `toggle-pin`: Pin/unpin album in library list.
  - `add-to-collection`: "Move to folder", supports existing folders, creating new folders, or moving to root.
- **Folder (Collection) Context Menu**:
  - `rename-collection`: Opens `RenameFolderModal` to update folder title via `ctx.library.renameCollection`.
  - `delete-collection`: Danger tone with divider, deletes collection and cascades child relationships.
  - `toggle-pin`: Pin/unpin folder in library list.
  - `create-playlist` & `create-folder`: Creates items directly within the selected folder.
  - `move-to-folder`: Move folder to another folder or root via `ctx.library.moveCollection`.
  - `add-to-playlist`: "Add to other playlists". Uses `collectAllFolderTracks` to **recursively traverse** all nested playlist tracks, nested album tracks, and all nested subfolder contents without duplicates (folders do not contain direct tracks).
  - `enqueue`: Plays all aggregated tracks across the folder hierarchy.

#### Library Presentation Modes
- **Collapsed mode** (72px rail): Minimalist icon list with consistent folder outline icons. When entering a folder, displays a `chevron-left` return button below the top brand logo to navigate back to the root library.
- **Sidebar mode** (260–340px): Standard view featuring inline expandable folders via rotating chevron controls (`chevron-down` / `chevron-right`), indented child items (28px padding), and dedicated folder detail view (`chevron-left Folder Title`). Playlists inside folders are automatically hidden from the root list (`containedPlaylistUrns`) and restored when moved to root.
- **Expanded mode** (full-canvas): High-density 3-column table view (`Title`, `Date Added`, `Last Played`) with top breadcrumb navigation (`音乐库 < 文件夹名`).

### Detail screens, sorting & media views

1. **Album, Playlist, Local Music & Favorites Track Tables**:
   - **Table Header Sorting**: Column headers (`#`, `标题`, `专辑`, `添加日期`, `时长` with Tabler `clock` icon, `播放量`) support interactive sorting with ascending/descending directional indicators (`chevron-up` / `chevron-down`). Column headers omit the legacy checkmark.
   - **Action Bar Sort Menu**: Dropdown `ContextMenu` ("默认顺序" / "自定义顺序" with Tabler `arrows-sort` or `list` icon) providing rapid switching between sorting keys and directions.
   - **Row Hover Library Action (`TrackLibraryActionButton`) & Popover**: Across track rows in `LocalMusicScreen`, `PlaylistDetailScreen`, `FavoritesScreen`, and `CollectionScreen`, the static checkmark is replaced with a hover action icon. When hovered, tracks not in library show `plus` (clicking saves to Favorites via `library.setSaved(track.urn, true)`); tracks in library show `heart-filled` (green heart), clicking opens a dedicated Spotify-style `SaveToPlaylistPopover` offering real-time playlist search, inline playlist creation, liked songs toggle, and folder tree navigation.
   - **Album Header & Menu**: `AlbumScreen` features an Action Bar heart button (`heart` / `heart-filled`) bound to `library.setSaved(album.urn, isSaved)` displaying saved albums in the user's Library. Local albums (`BBeBee:local:`) omit download buttons in header and rows, and omit the download menu item. Three-dot menu provides "加入文件夹", "添加到音乐库/从音乐库中删除", "加入播放列表", and "睡眠定时器" (omitting "加入歌单" and "转至专辑").
   - **Playback Queue Alignment**: Playing tracks from a sorted table (single-tap or "Play All") passes the sorted URN sequence to `ctx.player.playFromContext`, ensuring the playback queue matches visual order.
   - **Playlist Item ID Decoupling**: In `PlaylistDetailScreen`, rows wrap data as `{ item, track, trackUrn, originalIndex }`, preserving item IDs across sort operations so that removals and context menus act on the correct playlist item.
   - **Favorites Parity (`FavoritesScreen`)**: Styled with immersive purple gradient header, 56px play button, shuffle, real-time search filter, and `FavoriteTrackTableRow` with hover `TrackLibraryActionButton` (`heart-filled` / `heart` submenu).

2. **Local Music Dual Views (Tracks & Albums)**:
   - **Full Pagination**: `fetchAllLocalTracks` and `fetchAllLocalAlbums` recursively paginate in batches of 500 until all local items are retrieved, removing the former 100-item truncation.
   - Header segmented toggle allows switching between "歌曲" (table list) and "专辑" (grid view).
   - Album grid view aggregates local tracks into `LocalAlbumCard` components with cover artwork, title, artist, track count, and hover play trigger.
   - Sort dropdown adapts dynamically to album-specific criteria (name, artist, year, track count).

3. **Playback History & Recent Plays**:
   - **Deduplication**: `HistoryScreen` (desktop and mobile) and `QueueScreen` (recent plays tab) de-duplicate tracks by `trackUrn`, retaining only the most recent playback record (with its relative timestamp and completion badge).
   - **Play Count Indicator**: `HistoryScreen` displays a `播放 N 次` capsule badge indicating total plays per track.
   - **Count Consistency**: Header counters (`(${uniqueRecords.length} 首)`) and empty state checks evaluate against deduplicated unique tracks.

### The source surfaces

Four screens carry the whole string model, and they are worth naming because they are the part of
the UI that has no equivalent in a conventional player. The descriptors come from
`plugin-sources` and the views from `plugin-sources-ui-{mobile,desktop}` — all four are ordinary
descriptors, nothing about them is privileged.

| Screen | Does | Notes on the split |
|---|---|---|
| **Source list** | Enable, disable, reorder, group, and see each source's health badge; delete asks once and takes the cached catalogue with it ([06 §4.1](../sources/runtime.md#41-a-sources-lifetime)). The local-files row shows the scanner's folders with the same use/delete controls as **Music folders** | Ordinary list; parity is free |
| **Import review** | Show what a pasted string contains — added / updated / rejected, and the host allowlist — before anything is written ([06 §9](../sources/authoring.md#9-importing-updating-and-sharing)) | The one screen that must never be skipped, so it is a modal route on both, not a slot |
| **Test a source** | Run one feature — search, browse, album, artist, playlist, lyrics, library, stream, a raw HTTP request, or arbitrary script — and show every rule's input, output and timing ([06 §10](../sources/authoring.md#10-diagnosing-a-broken-source)) | The list of test areas is the source's derived capability list, so the screen shows what that source can actually do; the trace is a long scrollable log, the closest thing in the app to a developer tool, and the reason a user can fix a source themselves |
| **Search** | One query fanned out over the selected sources with `searchAll`, one result section per source ([06 §4.1](../sources/runtime.md#41-a-sources-lifetime)) | Before the first search the bar and the interface toggles are a hero; afterwards both collapse to the top and the results take the height. On desktop, search can also be executed directly from the persistent TopBar interactive input with its 2×2 matrix dropdown. The search screen (`sources.search`) accepts incoming `query` parameters and triggers `searchAll` automatically. **One toggle per interface, not per source** — a backend with a separate artist search shows `Source · Songs` and `Source · Artists` independently, and the selection reaches `searchAll` as `typesBySource`. Selections are stored as *exclusions*, so a source imported later joins the next search instead of being silently missed — and a source that failed, timed out or matched nothing keeps its own header instead of vanishing into a merged list |
| **DSP & Equalizer** | 10-band graphic equalizer with preset switching (Flat, Bass Boost, Vocal, Treble), effect chain ordering, individual effect bypass toggles, and parameter editing (normalize, compressor, reverb, etc.). Contributed as `dsp.view`. Opened directly from the player or via an action button in the playback settings card. | Descriptors in `plugin-dsp-ui-*`. Desktop renders a dedicated view with vertical sliders; mobile provides touch-friendly vertical sliders, chip selectors, and full chain navigation |
| **Settings Center** | All-in-one single-page scrolling settings center (`settings.view`) with text anchor tabs: General & Language, Playback & Audio, Desktop Lyrics (line mode, alignment, font, size, color picker, opacity, live preview), Global Hotkeys (master toggle + 10 keybindings), Network & Proxy (HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5, Google latency probe, per-source routing switches), Storage & Cache (directory badges with change/open folder buttons), and About with an Advanced Settings toggle guarding the Danger Zone. | Descriptors in `plugin-settings` and rendered by `plugin-settings-ui-*`. |
| **Debug & Diagnostics** | Dedicated diagnostic hub comprising three views: `debug.view` (Debug status, environment specs for Node, Electron, OS, Chromium), `debug.logs` (Discover live ring-buffer logs with search, level filters, NDJSON copy, clear), and `debug.http-logs` (live inspection of third-party source network requests with method, status badge, latency, and URL). | Descriptors in `plugin-settings` and views in `plugin-settings-ui-desktop`. |

A download starts from the **⬇ control on a track row** (`TrackRow.onDownload`, present only where
`ctx.downloads` is loaded) in the library, an album and the search results.

The rule that keeps this affordable is [§1](#1-the-three-package-convention)'s: parsing,
validating, diffing, tracing and redacting all live in the headless package. The view packages
show a list, a text field, and a set of toggles. The library itself is `plugin-library-ui-*`
(playlists, albums and collections side by side), the album page is `plugin-album-ui-*`, and the
four above are the ones the string model added.

## 5. Navigation

| | Mobile | Desktop |
|---|---|---|
| Router | Expo Router (file-based) | A small in-memory router in `ui-kit-desktop` |
| Primary chrome | Bottom tab bar + stack | Persistent sidebar + content pane + TopBar |
| Contributed routes | Registered as dynamic routes; `placement` decides tab bar vs. more-menu | Sidebar entries ordered by `order` (excluding Search & Settings, which use TopBar) |
| Back | OS gesture / hardware button | In-app history, plus `Cmd/Ctrl+[` |
| Deep links | `BBeBee://` scheme via `expo-linking` | Same scheme registered with the OS by `main` |

Both shells implement the same `navigate(routeId, params)` used by commands, so a command works on
either target without knowing which router is underneath.

---

## 7. Shell responsibilities

The shells are thin. Everything below is genuinely platform-specific and belongs nowhere else.

| | `apps/mobile` | `apps/desktop/renderer` |
|---|---|---|
| Boot | Create context, register `core-*-expo`, mount inside `ctx.inject(['ui'], …)` | Same with `core-*-node` |
| Chrome | Tab bar, stack headers, safe-area insets | Sidebar, TopBar (central search + 2×2 matrix, profile avatar), window controls, resizable panes |
| Player surface | Mini player above the tab bar; expands to full screen | Persistent bottom bar; optional detached mini-player window |
| Platform-only | Gestures, haptics, pull-to-refresh | Right-click menus, drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts, tray, command palette |
| Absent | No keyboard shortcuts, no tray | No gestures, no haptics |

The desktop **command palette** (`Cmd/Ctrl+K`) is worth calling out: it renders
`ctx.ui.commands` directly, so every plugin command is reachable with zero UI work from the plugin
author. It is the highest-leverage piece of shell code in the project.

### 7.1 Desktop Shell Navigation & TopBar Interaction

The desktop shell organizes primary navigation between the left sidebar and the top bar:

0. **TopBar placement**: The TopBar is **embedded at the top of the main content pane** (not a
   full-width row above the workspace), so the sidebar and the queue panel run the full window
   height. When the library's expanded mode takes over the workspace, the TopBar moves into the
   expanded library pane instead (sticky, so the window controls stay reachable). There is no
   standalone Home button — Home lives on the brand logo and the More menu — and the centered
   search input is deliberately narrow (`max-width: 360px`). With the queue panel open, the
   window controls sit at the top-right of the main pane, left of the queue.

1. **Left Sidebar Filtering**:
   - The left navigation rail is dedicated to browsing user content and collections (`library.view`, `history.view`, user playlists).
   - Global utility entries — specifically `settings.view` (Settings Center) and `sources.search` (Search) — are intentionally excluded from sidebar route rendering to avoid visual clutter and maintain Spotify-style navigation parity.
   - The **library sidebar** keeps two quick entries — 喜欢 (heart, with the saved-track count) and 本地和下载 (download, with the local-track count) — between the "音乐库" title and the filter pills; they navigate to `library.favorites` / `library.local`, highlight the active one, and stay visible in the collapsed rail as two icon tiles. The 艺人 filter chip renders only when the library actually holds artists, the 已下载 chip is gone, and the sort label hides while the in-library search field is open.
   - The **filter row** itself is flat: the 歌单/专辑(/艺人) buttons carry no pill background — the active one is marked by an outer glow (`--glow-brand-sm`) — and hairline vertical separators divide them. The create trigger moved out of the header into this row's far right as an icon-only plus (its dropdown — 创建歌单/创建文件夹 — anchors beneath it); the header keeps only the title and the expand button.

1a. **Track & Album View Modes (紧凑/列表/平铺)**:
   - The album, playlist, favourites and local-music pages offer a **视图模式** section at the bottom of the 排序方式 dropdown menu (`viewModeMenuItems` in `ui-kit-desktop`): a flush-left muted heading (`MenuItemSpec.heading`, no icon slot, no hover) behind a hairline divider, then one entry per mode with a check on the active one.
   - **列表 (list)** is the default and matches the historical row: artwork, title with artists beneath, album, date, duration. **紧凑 (compact)** drops the artwork and promotes artists to their own column (header included). The local-albums tab additionally offers **平铺 (tiled)** — the current card grid (`LocalAlbumCard`) — as its default, with 列表/紧凑 rendering album rows instead.
   - The choice persists per page in `localStorage` (`bbebee_view_mode:<key>` via `useViewMode`), so a page the user prefers compact stays compact across restarts.

2. **TopBar Interactive Search & 2×2 Matrix Dropdown**:
   - **Dynamic Search Icon Shift**:
     - *Idle state*: The search icon (`search`) rests at the left padding (`left: 12px`).
     - *Active / Focused state*: The icon smoothly slides across to the far right (`right: 12px`, with transition `all 200ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`) and functions as an interactive submit button (`cursor: pointer`).
     - *Dismissal*: Clicking outside the search area or pressing `Escape` unfocuses the input, dismisses the dropdown, and resets the icon back to the left edge.
   - **2×2 Matrix Floating Dropdown Panel**:
     - Automatically reveals directly beneath the input (`top: calc(100% + 8px)`, width 600px, z-index 1000) when the input is focused or query text is entered.
     - Structured as a 2-row × 2-column grid:
       - **Row 1**: Left header: "搜索范围" (`Search Scope`); Right header: "搜索历史" (`Search History`) accompanied by a subtle, high-transparency "清空" (`Clear`) button (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4)`).
       - **Row 2**:
          - *Left cell (Search Scope)*: Third-party music source toggle buttons connected to `useSearchSourceSelection(ctx)`. Renders individual source interface chips (styled with active green `#1DB954` fill and black text) alongside "全部" (All) and "重置" (None) batch toggles. Source selections are maintained in a shared store backed by `useSyncExternalStore` and persisted as exclusions in `localStorage` (`bbebee_search_sources_excluded`) so that TopBar and `SearchScreen` stay strictly synchronized bi-directionally, and newly installed sources participate automatically.
          - *Right cell (Search History)*: Interactive history tags stored in `localStorage` (`bbebee_search_history`, max 10 entries). Clicking any tag immediately executes that query. When history is empty, a subtle "暂无搜索历史" fallback is displayed.
    - **Search Submission & Screen Routing**:
      - Pressing `Enter`, clicking the shifted right search icon, or clicking a history tag commits the query into history, closes the matrix panel, and calls `navigate('sources.search', { query, sourceIds, typesBySource, searchTimestamp })`.
      - `SearchScreen` (`plugin-sources-ui-desktop`) watches incoming `query`, `sourceIds`, `typesBySource`, and `searchTimestamp` props via `useEffect` and automatically executes `search.searchAll(query, { sourceIds, typesBySource })`, ensuring search scope restrictions chosen in TopBar take immediate effect on the search screen.

3. **TopBar User Profile & Settings Access**:
   - The user profile avatar icon is anchored in the right cluster of the TopBar.
   - Clicking the avatar navigates directly to `settings.view` (Settings Center).

4. **Safe Service Access in UI Hooks**:
   - Cordis Context instances are strictly scoped (`ctx.inject`). Accessing an un-injected property throws an error at runtime (`cannot get property "<name>" without inject`).
   - Hooks in UI view layers inspecting optional services (e.g., `useSources`, `useLiveSourceIds`, and `useSearchSourceOptions`) must always access service instances safely using `serviceOf<T>(ctx, key)` instead of raw member access `(ctx as any)[key]`.

### 7.2 Secondary Windows and Single-Kernel Preservation

When desktop features require OS-level window detachment — such as **Desktop Lyrics** and the **Mini Player / Dynamic Island** which must float on top of other desktop applications, remain visible when the main window is minimized, support arbitrary multi-monitor dragging, and provide click-through mouse event forwarding when locked:

1. **Single Cordis Kernel Invariant (ADR-3)**: The secondary `BrowserWindow` must **never** call `boot()` or initialize a secondary Cordis Context. Starting a second kernel would split plugin states, duplicate playback hooks, and violate singletons.
2. **Passive View Architecture**: The secondary window runs as a passive React view loaded via query/hash routing (`?window=desktop-lyrics`, `?window=mini-player` or `#mini-player`). It mounts a standalone, lightweight view component directly without activating Cordis plugins.
3. **IPC Forwarding Hub**: The main renderer's UI adapter (`plugin-desktop-lyrics-ui-desktop`, `plugin-mini-player-ui-desktop`) syncs state down to the secondary window through IPC (`window.BBeBee.desktopLyrics.updateData(...)`, `window.BBeBee.miniPlayer.updateData(...)`), and receives user actions back from the secondary window through `sendAction(...)` dispatched to `ctx.player` and the respective feature service.
4. **OS Integration**:
   - Frameless transparent window (`frame: false`, `transparent: true`, `backgroundColor: '#00000000'`, `alwaysOnTop: true`, `skipTaskbar: true`).
   - Free dragging via CSS `-webkit-app-region: drag` and interactive buttons via `-webkit-app-region: no-drag`.
   - Mouse click-through: `setIgnoreMouseEvents(locked, { forward: true })` toggled dynamically upon lock state where applicable.

5. **Desktop Lyrics Interaction Without Drag Regions**:
   - The lyrics window root must never carry `-webkit-app-region: drag`: a drag region swallows the mouse events the hover toolbar depends on (the reason the toolbar once never appeared). Dragging is manual instead — pointer capture plus `desktop-lyrics:set-position` IPC using `screenX/screenY` deltas, and the final position is reported through `desktop-lyrics:commit-position` when the drag ends (programmatic moves are echo-suppressed in main).
   - While locked (click-through), the lyrics window shows a single 解锁 pill at the toolbar spot. Because `forward` is a no-op on Linux, **main polls the OS cursor** (`desktop-lyrics:cursor`) while the window is locked and visible; the renderer shows the pill only while the cursor is over the window and flips mouse handling (`set-ignore-mouse`) as the cursor crosses the pill, so the rest of the window stays click-through.

### 7.3 Mini Player & Dynamic Island Window Architecture

The **Mini Player / Dynamic Island** (`plugin-mini-player` and `plugin-mini-player-ui-desktop`) provides a dedicated secondary floating window with dynamic morphing between a standard floating media pill and an Apple-inspired "Dynamic Island" docked at the screen top:

1. **Three Window States & Seamless Transitions**:
   - **Floating Mini Player (`normal`)**: Compact 380×96px rounded pill with cover artwork, track title, artist, progress scrubber, and media controls. The entire card body is draggable (`-webkit-app-region: drag`), while buttons and interactive sliders opt out (`-webkit-app-region: no-drag`). Includes restore-to-main (`⤢`) and close (`✕`) buttons.
   - **Dynamic Island Capsule (`attached`)**: Ultra-compact 280×50px pill docked flush against the top edge of the active screen. Displays track title, artist, and live audio wave bars (`IslandWaveBars`). Clicking expands into full island view; double-clicking collapses.
   - **Expanded Dynamic Island (`expanded`)**: Expanded 420×184px card docked at the screen top. Features large cover art, track info with marquee scrolling, animated frequency wave bars, timeline scrubber, and transport controls. Double-clicking collapses back to capsule; dragging downward past the detach threshold (>60px) detaches it back into a floating mini player.

2. **Multi-Display Edge Snapping & Detachment**:
   - Handled natively in `MiniPlayerWindowManager` (`apps/desktop/main/mini-player-manager.ts`).
   - When the user drags the floating window within `TOP_SNAP_THRESHOLD` (≤40px) of the top edge of *any* connected display (`screen.getDisplayMatching(bounds)`), the window automatically snaps to horizontal center (`(bounds.width - attachedWidth) / 2`) and transitions to `attached` Dynamic Island mode.
   - Dragging the Dynamic Island downwards past `60px` automatically triggers detachment, resizing and restoring the window back to its previous floating coordinates (`lastFloatingPos`).

3. **Gesture-First Interaction**:
   - Redundant explicit toggle buttons ("折叠灵动岛", "脱离吸附", "吸附到顶部") are omitted to prevent visual clutter.
   - Dragging near the top snaps to island; dragging down detaches; clicking the capsule expands; double-clicking the background collapses back to capsule; clicking the dancing wave bars in the expanded island also collapses back to the capsule.
   - The window is absent from the taskbar (`skipTaskbar: true`) — the main window's entry represents the app in both mini-player and Dynamic Island modes.

4. **Security & Artwork Path Resolution**:
   - Chromium blocks `file://` resources inside renderer documents with `ERR_UNKNOWN_URL_SCHEME` / security violations.
   - `resolveArtworkUri()` in `plugin-mini-player` automatically translates local paths from `file://` to Electron's privileged custom scheme `bbebee-file://`.
   - `IslandArtwork` implements anonymous cross-origin loading (`crossOrigin="anonymous"`, `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"`) and provides error boundary fallback to a crisp vector note icon if an image is corrupted or missing.

5. **Crisp Dark Glass Design Standards**:
   - Translucent dark glass styling (`rgba(18, 18, 18, 0.85)` with `backdrop-filter: blur(24px)`).
   - High-contrast border line (`1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)`).
   - Multi-tier black ambient drop shadows (`0 6px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.45), 0 1px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)`), eliminating excessive fuzzy glow halos or wide white spread rings on transparent windows.

## 8. Accessibility

Not a phase-two concern, because retrofitting it is far more expensive than doing it.

- Every interactive element has an accessible name — `accessibilityLabel` on mobile,
  `aria-label` on desktop — supplied through the shared component props so it is written once.
- Desktop is fully keyboard navigable: visible focus rings, logical tab order, `Escape` closes
  every overlay, arrow keys move within lists.
- Mobile respects the OS text-size setting; the token scale is relative, and layouts are tested at
  200%.
- Contrast meets WCAG AA against both palettes — checked in the parity test, not by eye.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` (desktop) and Reduce Motion (mobile) disable the crossfade animations
  and the artwork parallax.
- The visualiser and any flashing element honour reduced-motion and are never the sole indicator
  of state.

## 9. Where to go next

[09 — Project Structure](../workflow/structure.md) turns all of this into a directory tree, a
build pipeline, and a set of enforced rules.
