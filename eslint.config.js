/**
 * The rules that matter here are the architectural ones. Style is secondary;
 * these exist because code review will not catch them reliably and each
 * protects a specific claim in docs/.
 *
 * They are the layer model of docs/02-architecture.md §1 made mechanical:
 *
 *   Layer 5  apps/* · packages/ui/*      pages, interactions, orchestration
 *   Layer 4  packages/feature/*          business features
 *   Layer 3  packages/logs/*             log transports — the only layer that
 *                                               may write to the console
 *   Layer 2  packages/core/*             the only layer allowed to call a
 *                                               platform SDK or drive the kernel
 *   Layer 1  packages/kernel      DI, fibers, config, loader, gate
 *   Layer 0  packages/protocol  contracts, zero runtime
 *
 * Every glob below keys off the layer *directory*, so a package is governed by
 * where it lives rather than by how it is spelled. Moving a package between
 * layers is the moment its rules change, and that is now one `git mv`.
 *
 * A layer names anything below it, but Layers 3, 4 and 5 name Layer 2 through
 * *service keys* declared at Layer 0 — never by import. That is what the
 * `@BBeBee/core-*` bans below are for; the docs/09 §3 matrix is this file,
 * read as a table.
 *
 * Layer 3 is reached the same way and by the same rule: a feature plugin logs
 * through `ctx.logger`, which Cordis provides and the transports subscribe to,
 * so it never names `@BBeBee/plugin-log-*` either. The pair of rules that make
 * that real are the `LOG_PACKAGES` ban and `no-console` — one closes the
 * import, the other closes the way around it.

 * gate.
 *
 * Expressed as an allow-list rather than a ban-list on purpose. The bootstrap

 * by default, which is the safe direction to fail in — and
