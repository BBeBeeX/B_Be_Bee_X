/**
 * The `=` template evaluator — the M1 slice of the rule language.
 *
 * A rule is a selector unless it starts with `=`. This module implements the
 * `=` half and nothing else: literal text with `{{ }}` interpolation, which is
 * exactly what a stream URL needs and the smallest useful piece of the
 * language (docs/11 MD-7).
 *
 * The selector engines, combinators, `@put`/`@get` and `@js:` arrive with the
 * rest of the runtime. Until they do, a rule this module cannot understand is
 * **refused, not passed through as a literal** — see `evaluateRule`. Silently
 * treating an unrecognised rule as text is the failure mode that would make
 * every later rule bug harder to find, because the symptom appears three steps
 * downstream as a URL that is not a URL.
 *
 * Deliberately pure: no I/O, no platform, no Cordis. It takes a template and a
 * scope and returns a string, which is what makes the rule corpus runnable
 * without a network.
 *
 * See docs/06-music-sources.md §3.1–§3.2.
