/**
 * Conformance suite for the `ctx.db` capability gate.
 *
 * Modelled on `fs-scope`, and for the same reason: `db:own` was enforced in
 * `core-db-node` while `DbBridge` had no gate at all, so the guarantee held
 * in tests and evaporated on the desktop path. A suite both implementations
 * run is the only thing that keeps them honest.
 *
 * Separate from `dbConformance` because it needs a *gated* database — one
 * derived through `scopeContext` with a specific grant — where the main suite
 * runs ungated.
