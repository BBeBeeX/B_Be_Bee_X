/**
 * The **source document** — a music backend, as a string a user can import.
 *
 * A source is data, not a package. The user pastes JSON (one object, or an
 * array of them); the runtime interprets it. Nobody outside this repository
 * implements `MediaProvider`; they write one of these instead. This is the
 * legado book-source model applied to audio.
 *
 * Two properties of the shape are load-bearing and easy to lose:
 *
 *  - **Every rule value is a rule string**, never a plain value, even when it
 *    looks like one. A constant is written `=audio/mpeg`; without the `=` it
 *    is a selector for an element type that does not exist. See docs/06 §3.1.
 *  - **No credential ever appears in a document.** Credentials live in
 *    `ctx.secrets` and `source_vars`, outside `doc_json`, so "share this
 *    source" is safe by construction rather than by the sharer remembering
 *    (docs/06 §5, docs/07 §4.1).
 *
 * See docs/06-music-sources.md §2.
