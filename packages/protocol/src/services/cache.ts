/**
 * `ctx.cache` — the media cache plugin's surface.
 *
 * Two kinds of bytes go through here, and neither is a download: **artwork**
 * (a cover is fetched once, then every `<Artwork>` reads a local file — which
 * is also what lets `ctx.mediaSession` receive a local `Uri` on mobile) and
 * **remote audio streams** (a track plays from the network once, is written
 * beside the cache while it plays, and every later play opens the file).
 *
 * The distinction from `ctx.downloads` matters: a download is a file the user
 * asked to keep; a cache entry is evictable, is never shown as "Downloaded",
 * and an app with `plugin-cache` disabled simply streams. The player learns
 * nothing either way — the substitution happens on the
 * `player/before-resolve` waterfall, answered with `kind: 'local'`.
 *
 * Entries are tracked in `cache_entries` (docs/07 §4.11) and evicted LRU
 * within a class, because evicting artwork costs a re-fetch and a flicker
 * while evicting a stream costs the user a re-download.
 *
 * See docs/05 §2.
