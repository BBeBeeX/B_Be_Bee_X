/**
 * `ctx.library` — the user's curation: playlists, favourites, collections.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* the catalogue. `ctx.sources` owns which backends exist and
 * what they hold; this service owns what the user did with it. The split is
 * MD-3 in docs/11 §1.3, and it is what keeps the same SQL out of both view
 * packages: a screen calls `ctx.library` and never touches `ctx.db`.
 *
 * Three shapes of curation, one service:
 *
 *   favourites   `library_items` — "this URN is saved", toggleable, one row
 *   playlists    `playlists` + `playlist_items` — an ordered list of tracks,
 *                or a **smart** playlist, which stores a rule tree and
 *                resolves it to tracks at read time
 *   collections  `collections` + `collection_items` — nested folders holding
 *                any entity, ordered by a fractional index
 *
 * Playlists store their order as a fractional index (docs/07 §4.6), so moving
 * one track writes exactly one row. Smart playlists compile their rule tree to
 * **parameterised SQL only** — the compiler lives in `plugin-library/src/smart.ts`
 * and the field allowlist there is the security boundary, not a hint.
 *
 * See docs/07 §4.6.
