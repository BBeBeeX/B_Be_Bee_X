/**
 * `ctx.downloads` — the managed download queue.
 *
 * A download is a row in `download_tasks` (docs/07 §4.8) driven by one worker:
 * queued → running → done, with `paused`, `canceled` and `failed` as the
 * states a user or a network can put it in. What lands on disk is a
 * `media_bindings` row exactly like a scanned file's, so the player already
 * knows how to play it and `plugin-download`'s `player/before-resolve`
 * substitution needs no download concept at all.
 *
 * The service is deliberately small: state, the six verbs that move it, and
 * events. Progress is *emitted* per chunk, not stored per chunk — the row is
 * checkpointed so a kill resumes from near where it stopped, but the byte
 * counter a screen renders is the in-memory one.
 *
 * See docs/05 §2, docs/07 §4.8.
