/**
 * `ctx.sources` — the source registry and the catalogue cache.
 *
 * `MediaProvider` is what the rest of the app consumes, and it is now an
 * **internal interface with exactly two implementations**: the source
 * runtime's per-source adapter, and `plugin-source-local`. It is no longer an
 * extension point — nobody outside this repository implements it. A new music
 * backend is a `SourceDocument` (see `source-document.ts`), imported as a
 * string and interpreted by one built-in runtime.
 *
 * Keeping the interface is what stops the catalogue, the player and every
 * screen from growing an "is this a real source or a local file?" branch.
 *
 * See docs/06-music-sources.md.
