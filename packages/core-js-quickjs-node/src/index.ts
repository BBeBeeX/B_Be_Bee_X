/**
 * `ctx.js` on QuickJS — a real realm, not a `vm` context.
 *
 * The distinction is the whole point. `node:vm` shares an object graph with
 * the host: a script that reaches `this.constructor.constructor` is out, and
 * every published mitigation for that is a blocklist someone eventually walks
 * around. QuickJS is a separate interpreter compiled to WebAssembly — there is
 * no host object graph to reach, because there are no host objects in it. What
 * crosses the boundary crosses as data.
 *
 * That buys three things the source model needs (docs/06 §8):
 *
 *  - **Interruptible.** A `while(1)` is stopped by an interrupt handler the
 *    host polls. Nothing in JavaScript's own semantics can do this, which is
 *    why `source-rules` has to refuse catastrophic regexes rather than time
 *    them out.
 *  - **Bounded memory.** A per-realm heap ceiling, enforced by the allocator.
 *  - **Nothing ambient.** No `fetch`, no `require`, no timers. A realm reaches
 *    exactly the host functions the caller exposed and nothing else.
 *
 * ⚠️ The sandbox bounds *reach*, not *intent*. A script still sees everything
 * passed in and can send it anywhere an exposed function allows, which is why
 * the source runtime pairs this with a per-source egress allowlist.
 *
 * See docs/04-core-services.md §19.
