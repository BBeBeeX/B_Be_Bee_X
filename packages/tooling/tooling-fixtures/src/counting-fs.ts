/**
 * An instrumented `ctx.fs`.
 *
 * M1's first exit criterion is not "a rescan is fast" but "an incremental
 * rescan of an unchanged library costs **stat calls only**" (docs/10 §M1).
 * That is a claim about which methods were called, and the only way to check
 * it is to count them — a timing assertion would pass on a fast disk with a
 * scanner that reads every byte.
 *
 * The methods are patched **on the service instance**, not wrapped in a new
 * object. A cordis service is one instance shared by every fiber, and each
 * fiber reaches it through its own scoped `Context`; replacing `ctx.fs` on the
 * root context leaves every plugin still talking to the original, so a wrapper
 * would count nothing and quietly report success. Patching the instance is
 * what makes the count cover the scanner *and* the codec reading through it.
 *
 * Dev-only. Nothing here is bundled into either shell.
