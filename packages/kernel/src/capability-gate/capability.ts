 * The capability gate.

 * Each plugin runs in a context where every mediated core service has been
 * `intercept`ed with the plugin's grants. The service reads that config and
 * refuses out-of-scope operations. Because services are reached through
 * Cordis's proxy, a plugin cannot walk the object graph to an unscoped
 * reference.
 *
 * ⚠️ This is defense in depth, NOT a sandbox. Plugins execute in the same JS
 * realm as the app and can reach globals and patch prototypes. The gate makes
 * overreach *auditable and revocable*; it does not contain a hostile plugin.
 * It is not asked to: every plugin is first-party and ships in the build.
 *
 * The code that *is* untrusted — an imported music source's rules — is
 * contained by a different and much stronger mechanism, `ctx.js`, whose realm
 * shares nothing with the app. See docs/03 §7 and docs/06 §8.
