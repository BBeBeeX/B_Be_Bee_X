/**
 * Writing a provider's answers into the catalogue.
 *
 * docs/06 §1: a provider answers questions and returns plain data; `ctx.sources`
 * is what stores the answers. This is that storing — the write half of the file
 * `catalog.ts` reads back, and the step docs/06 §4's sequence diagram calls
 * "cache rows, index FTS".
 *
 * Two things depend on it, and only one of them is obvious:
 *
 *  - **Offline browsing.** A search result survives the network going away.
 *  - **Playing at all, later.** `tracks.raw_json` holds the provider's own
 *    payload for each track, and `ruleStream` reads it back as `{{track.*}}`
 *    (docs/06 §4). Without this write, a document whose stream URL needs
 *    anything beyond the URN's id resolved during the search that fetched it
 *    and failed after a restart.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* a second copy of `plugin-local-scanner`'s `importTrack`.
 * That one turns file metadata into rows; this one turns `Track` objects — the
 * protocol's own shape — into the same rows. Sharing them would mean one
 * function with two unrelated input types and a flag, which is how the
 * scanner's file-specific columns would start leaking into remote rows.
