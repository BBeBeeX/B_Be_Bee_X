 * `useToggleFavorite`, the one control two stores share.
 *
 * The heart has to write both `track_stats.loved` (what draws it) and the
 * library shelf (what the Favourites screen lists). A hook that wrote only one
 * would leave the two disagreeing in a way the user sees; a hook that threw
 * because one service was absent would take the other down with it.
