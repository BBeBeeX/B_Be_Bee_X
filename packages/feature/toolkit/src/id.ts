/**
 * Stable ids for things that have none.
 *
 * A local track has no remote id, so one is derived from the thing that
 * identifies it: its file Uri. Derived rather than random because the same
 * file must produce the same URN on every scan — otherwise a rescan orphans
 * every playlist entry, every queue row and every play record that referred to
 * it. The same argument covers every writer of catalogue rows, which is why
 * this lives here and not in the scanner.
 *
 * FNV-1a: a few lines, no dependency, and stable across platforms. It is not a
 * security hash and nothing here treats it as one — a collision would merge
 * two files, which is why the album and artist keys fold in more than a title.
