/**
 * Parsing a rule into the pipeline that evaluates it.
 *
 * A rule is one line in a form field on a phone, so the syntax is dense and
 * the parse has to be forgiving about what people actually type. It is also
 * the layer where a source author's mistake either becomes a clear message or
 * a silent wrong answer three steps later — so everything here fails loudly.
 *
 * Grammar, in the order it is applied:
 *
 *     rule       := alternative ( '||' alternative )*      first non-empty wins
 *     alternative:= concat ( '%%' concat )*                interleave
 *     concat     := atom ( '&&' atom )*                    concatenate
 *     atom       := ( '@put:{…}' | '@get:{…}' )* engine-selector replacement*
 *     replacement:= '##' pattern ( '##' replacement )? '###'?
 *
 * ⚠️ Precedence is `||` loosest, then `%%`, then `&&`. That is legado's, and
 * it is the useful one: `a && b || c` means "a-then-b, or else c", which is
 * how a fallback for a two-part field is written.
 *
 * See docs/06-music-sources.md §3.
