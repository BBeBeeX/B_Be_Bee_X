 * over from a search. The user plays from their library hours later, offline

  /**
   * Run one feature of this source with everything it does on show.
   *
   * The transport behind the test screen: each `DebugStep` kind maps onto one
   * `MediaProvider` operation, and while it runs every HTTP request the
   * operation makes becomes a trace line (through the `http` getter), every
   * `src.log` line the document prints is mirrored in, and the operation's
   * whole output is handed back as a `value` event. Three properties do the
   * work (docs/06 §10):
   *
   *  - **It streams.** A request to a server that has stopped answering shows
   *    as an `http` line with no status and nothing after it — which is the
   *    diagnosis. Collecting first would show nothing until it gave up.
   *  - **It redacts.** A trace is what gets pasted into a forum thread, and a
   *    Subsonic URL carries a password hash and its salt as a matter of course.
   *  - **A missing feature is an answer, not a crash.** A source whose
   *    document has no `ruleAlbum` block has no album lookup to run, and the
   *    trace says so plainly.
