/**
 * `ctx.device` on iOS and Android.
 *
 * The counterpart of `core-device-electron`, and deliberately the same shape:
 * what the network is doing, what the battery is doing, and which keys the
 * user pressed. The last of those is a desktop concept, so it is a no-op
 * disposer here rather than a thrown error — a plugin asking for a media key
 * on a phone should get "nothing will happen", not a crash (docs/04 §11).
 *
 * ⚠️ Everything degrades rather than throws. A build without `expo-battery`
 * linked still answers `battery()` with `undefined`; a device that will not
 * report its connection type still answers `network()`. A missing OS
 * capability must cost a feature, never a boot.
 *
 * See docs/04 §11 and docs/11 §4.3.
