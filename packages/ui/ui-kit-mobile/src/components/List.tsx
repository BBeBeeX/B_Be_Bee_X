/**
 * A virtualised list.
 *
 * FlashList recycles row views instead of mounting one per item, which is what
 * a 100k-track library needs on a phone. Its twin on desktop windows the same
 * way with `@tanstack/react-virtual` (docs/11 §4.11).
 *
 * ⚠️ `estimatedItemSize` is deliberately not forwarded. FlashList v2 measures
 * rows itself and dropped the prop; passing it would look like a hint and be
 * ignored. The prop stays in the shared contract because the desktop
 * virtualiser genuinely needs it, and a prop one kit ignores is cheaper than
 * two contracts.
