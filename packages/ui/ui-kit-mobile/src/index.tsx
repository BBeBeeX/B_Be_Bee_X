/**
 * `@BBeBee/ui-kit-mobile` - the parity component set, React Native.
 *
 * Twin of `ui-kit-desktop`: same names, same props, same tokens. `ui-parity`
 * fails the build if they diverge, because the moment `Button` takes
 * `onPress` on one and `onClick` on the other, every plugin author pays for
 * it twice, forever (docs/08 6).
 *
 * ⚠️ **`react-native` is injected, not imported.** The repo's existing mobile
 * view packages do the same, and the reason is worth stating: importing it
 * pulls in native modules, so the package could not be typechecked or
 * unit-tested anywhere but a device — and a check that only runs on one of two
 * platforms is most of the way to no check at all. The shell calls
 * `configureNative` once at boot with the real module.
