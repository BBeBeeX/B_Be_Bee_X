/**
 * `ctx.codec` on iOS and Android.
 *
 * ## Why this extends the desktop implementation rather than duplicating it
 *
 * docs/11 §4.1 sketches this package as "`AudioDecoder` plus a native tag
 * reader". Half of that is right and half of it is not, and the difference is
 * worth stating because the file looks surprisingly short.
 *
 * Tag reading in `core-codec-node` is `music-metadata` over `ctx.fs` — no
 * `node:fs`, no Node API, nothing platform-shaped anywhere in it. Its own
 * header says so: "pure JavaScript … the same implementation works in the
 * Electron renderer and in `main`". A *native* tag reader here would add a
 * native module to every mobile build in order to produce a second answer to a
 * question that already has one, and the risk register's second-loudest entry
 * is two implementations of one service drifting apart. So the tag half is
 * inherited, and the bounded head read — the property that decides whether a
 * 5,000 file scan takes minutes or an afternoon — is inherited with it.
 *
 * What genuinely differs is the two things that are actually about the device:
 *
 * - **`supportedFormats()`**, which is the OS decoder's answer and differs by
 *   OS version. It is configured by the shell, which knows its engine.
 * - **`decode()`**, which is `react-native-audio-api`'s `decodeAudioData`
 *   rather than the renderer's — the one place a platform SDK is genuinely
 *   required.
 *
 * ⚠️ `music-metadata` on Hermes is the open risk. It is pure JavaScript but
 * leans on `TextDecoder`, which RN provides only for a subset of encodings —
 * enough for UTF-8 tags, not for a Latin-1 ID3v2.3 tag written by a 2004
 * ripper. The failure mode is a mangled title on an old file, not a crash, and
 * confirming it needs a device (docs/11 §8).
 *
 * See docs/04 §13 and docs/11 §4.1.
