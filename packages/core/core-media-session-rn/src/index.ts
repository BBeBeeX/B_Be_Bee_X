/**
 * `ctx.mediaSession` on iOS and Android.
 *
 * One surface where desktop has two: `react-native-audio-api`'s playback
 * notification *is* the lock screen on iOS and the media notification on
 * Android, including the Android 14+ foreground service behind it. So this
 * package is thinner than `core-media-session-electron` and has the harder
 * job, because on mobile the OS surface is the primary way people control
 * playback rather than a convenience.
 *
 * Two things are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:
 *
 * - **Artwork must be a local Uri.** So metadata is published *immediately*
 *   with whatever artwork is already local, and updated when an image lands.
 *   Delaying the whole update on an image fetch means a lock screen that stays
 *   blank for as long as the network takes (docs/11 §4.4).
 * - **`setSupportedCommands` must genuinely change the buttons.** A disabled
 *   control is `enableControl(name, false)`, not an ignored press: a button
 *   that does nothing is worse than a button that is not there.
 *
 * ⚠️ Everything is feature-detected. A build where the native module is not
 * linked — a test, an Expo Go run — must degrade to *no OS surface* rather
 * than to a crashed player.
 *
 * See docs/04 §12 and docs/11 §4.4.
