/**
 * MD-4 on the *other* driver.
 *
 * The reason this file exists is the reason MD-4 exists: `db:own` was enforced
 * in `core-db-node` and not in `core-db-expo`, so the same manifest string
 * meant one thing on desktop and nothing on mobile — and nothing said so,
 * because the suite only ever ran against one implementation. M1's definition
 * of done asks for the `db-scope` suite on both, so here is the second.
 *
 * `expo-sqlite` is aliased to `node:sqlite` behind the Expo surface
 * (`test/stubs/expo-sqlite.ts`), so the statements really run against SQLite.
 * What stays on the device is the SDK's own SQLite *build* — its version, and
 * therefore `contentless_delete=1` (docs/11 §8).
