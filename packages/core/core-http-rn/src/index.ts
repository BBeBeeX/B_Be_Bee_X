/**
 * `ctx.http` on iOS and Android — the M1 slice.
 *
 * ## Why this extends the desktop implementation rather than duplicating it
 *
 * `core-http-node`'s own header says the transport is a seam and everything
 * around it is `fetch`-shaped: the cookie jars, the `net:host` gate, the
 * `http/request` waterfall, the redirect loop that re-checks the host on every
 * hop. None of that is Node — it is the *contract*, and it is roughly six
 * hundred lines of it. Written twice, the two copies would disagree about
 * something subtle within a month, and a source that signs in on desktop and
 * silently does not on mobile is exactly the drift the risk register calls the
 * second most expensive thing that can go wrong.
 *
 * So what is here is what is genuinely different: the transport.
 *
 * ## The transport
 *
 * **`expo/fetch`, not React Native's `fetch`.** RN's is XHR-backed and its
 * `Response.body` is `null` — there is no stream at all. Every one of M1's
 * streaming requirements dies on that: no `Range` seek that starts playing
 * before the file arrives, no `onProgress`, no stall that can be told apart
 * from a slow response. `expo/fetch` is WinterCG-compliant and gives a real
 * `ReadableStream`, which is why docs/04 §17's "verify `ReadableStream` on
 * RN 0.86, polyfill if absent" resolves to a package rather than a polyfill:
 * a polyfilled stream over a buffered XHR is a stream in shape only.
 *
 * See docs/04 §2, docs/04 §17 and docs/11 §4.5.
