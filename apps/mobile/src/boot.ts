/**
 * The mobile bootstrap — the **composition root**.
 *
 * One of docs/02 §1's three deliberate exceptions to the layer model, named by
 * path in `eslint.config.js`: the only files allowed to call `createApp` and
 * to import a Layer 2 `core-*` package directly. Wiring, not business
 * function — everything else under `apps/` is plain Layer 4.
 *
 * Compare with `apps/desktop/renderer/boot.ts`: the plugin registry is
 * generated from the same manifests and the config is the same list, and only
 * the core-service registrations differ. That is ADR-3 and the layer model
 * working (docs/02 §3).
 *
 * This file is also the *only* place `react-native` is imported outside a view
 * package: the kit takes its primitives from here, so nothing below the shell
 * has to know what it is rendering into (docs/08 §1).
